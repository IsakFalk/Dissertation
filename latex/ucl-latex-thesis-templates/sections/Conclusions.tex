Possible extensions:

The Authors of WaveNet has introduced ByteNet, might be
worthwhile looking into that as well as it is explicitly created to work well on
character level generative models (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1610.10099.pdf).

Kingma et. al has come with a new extension to VAE's which uses normalising
flows https://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.04934.pdf.
